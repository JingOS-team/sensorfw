## Sensor driver guideline
##

Sensord has been built to be easily adaptable to different driver interfaces
sensor drivers may expose. However, the following generic guidelines or
requests could be made for the driver implementations:

1) Try to follow upstream conventions and standards when available.
2) Avoid busy-polling by providing interrupts from driver handle
3) Power down the sensor if nobody is attached to the driver handle.
4) Provide easy way to configure sensor (sampling range, frequenzy, etc.),
preferably using sysfs.

Kernels input (evdev) system handles most of the above quite nicely.

Cheerios,
